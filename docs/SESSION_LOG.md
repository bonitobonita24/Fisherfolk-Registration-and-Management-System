## 2026-08-14 — "Calapan City" demo tenant seed (500+ fisherfolk, every menu populated) + v0.11.0 shipped

**In your words:** (overnight, full auto) push the authorized work, then build a fresh **demo tenant named "Calapan City"** with 500+ dummy fisherfolk (fabricated names, NOT the real registrants) each with a photo + signature, plus dummy vessels/violations/ayuda/etc all with images — make sure **no menu is blank**. Reuse random signatures from the official tenant; source person photos anywhere (no real photos/names).

✅ **Done & verified**
- **Released & pushed `v0.11.0`** — merged the held landing-page branch into `main`, consolidated changelog + version-sync + annotated tag, `git push --follow-tags origin main` (you confirmed the version). Both prior open push decisions closed.
- **Built an isolated demo tenant "Calapan City"** (`calapan-demo`) in **local dev only** — the real `calapan-city` data was never touched:
  - **500 fisherfolk** — fabricated Filipino names (disjoint from real registrants), every one with a **photo** (validated fake faces) + **signature** (reused from the official tenant's signatures, decoupled from any name).
  - **300 vessels** (all with photos), **60 violations** (evidence images + report attachments), **4 ayuda programs / 456 beneficiaries** (+ event photos & signed sheets), **120 fish catches**, **40 households**, **25 kanban tasks** (attachments), **30 notifications**, **15 edit requests**, **8 categories**, **2 ID templates**, **40 audit logs**, **20 renewals**, **3 import batches**, **2 ID-print batches**.
  - **Every sidebar menu confirmed populated** via a Playwright sweep of all 19 routes.
- **Fixed 2 issues found in verification:**
  - Portrait photos were saving a webpage instead of a real image → re-seeded from a reliable source **with image validation**; all 500 now render as real JPEGs.
  - The **Notifications page was an empty stub** → built it into a real notifications list (mark-as-read / mark-all). Now shows content.
- **Re-verified live** on the rebuilt dev container: fisherfolk photo+signature render, notifications list shows 16 items, vessel photo renders, 0 console errors.

🔑 **Demo logins** (local dev, tenant "Calapan City"): `admin@demo.com` (tenant_admin) · `demo-super@calapan-demo.local` (superadmin — needed to view Audit Log & User Management, which are correctly role-gated) · password `DemoCalapan_LocalDev_2026`.

💬 **Notes / decisions**
- All demo work is **LOCAL only** on branch `feat/calapan-demo-seed`. Pushing this demo to the live demo site (`frms-demo.powerbyte.app`) is a deliberate deploy that **needs your explicit word** (recorded in `PENDING_DECISIONS.md`).
- Audit Log & User Management look blank under the `admin@demo.com` login — that's **correct RBAC** (superadmin-only); use the superadmin login to showcase them.
- Minor cosmetic: reused signatures are served with an `image/png` label but are JPEG bytes — they render fine; left as-is.

## 2026-08-14 — Public landing page + login moved to /admin

**In your words:** resume/merge the held branches, then build an awesome, stunning public landing page
promoting the app's features (using the shadcnstudio "Craft" template as the basis), move the staff login
off the front page to a manually-typed `/admin`, and credit Blue Alliance + Powerbyte in the footer.

✅ **Done**
- Merged the 3 held branches into `main` (2 CGC refactors + Traefik fix), **local only** — verified green (tsc + 59 tests).
- Built the public landing page at `/`: animated coastal-wave hero, live-counting stats, 8-module feature grid, tabbed screenshot gallery (your existing app screenshots), how-it-works, and a footer crediting **Blue Alliance** (logo from Marine-Guardian) + **Powerbyte IT Solutions**. Light + dark, full SEO.
- Moved staff sign-in to **`/admin`** (not shown on the public page); `/login` still works (redirects to `/admin`); the app stays behind auth exactly as before.
- Verified it live in your real dev container — **open `localhost:44387`** to click through it. Passed the full production build gate.

🔨 **Partial / parked**
- All of it sits on branch `feat/public-landing-page` (commit `6268bc5`), **local only** — you said leave it on the branch.

⏳ **Next / your call**
- Merge + push the landing branch, and/or push `main` (12 commits ahead, held). Both are owner-gated.
- Optional: make the public landing default to **light** (it currently opens dark, matching the app). Copy/section tweaks (testimonials, contact block, different screenshots).

💬 **Notes**
- The landing's sections fade in as you scroll — that's intentional; the first screen (hero) shows instantly.
- Login is used by *all* staff roles, not just the tenant manager — so `/admin` is the entry for everyone; `/login` bookmarks keep working via redirect.
