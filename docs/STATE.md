# FRMS — Project State

## Current State (2026-07-01)

Branch `swarm/registration-status-timeline` is the active feature branch for the registration-status timeline work.

### Completed this session (S0)

- **Prisma schema** — `RegistrationRenewal` model added; `Fisherfolk` extended with `idReleasedAt`/`idReleasedById`/`idReleasedBy`/`renewals`; inverse relations wired on `User` and `Tenant`.
- **Migration** — `20260701000000_registration_renewal_and_id_released` (additive: CREATE TABLE + 2 ADD COLUMN).
- **Prisma client** regenerated (v6.19.3).
- **Typecheck** passes (0 errors).

### Completed this session (SD — docs wave)

- **DECISIONS_LOG.md** — appended 2026-07-01 entry with 5 locked sub-decisions (a–e): ID-release manual staff action, NEW/RENEWED badge derivation from `_count.renewals`, renew mutation rules (encoder role + active-violation block + AuditAction.RENEW), new entities (RegistrationRenewal + Fisherfolk.idReleasedAt/idReleasedById), activity timeline sanitization policy (action/actor/timestamp only, no diffs, protectedProcedure).
- **CHANGELOG_AI.md** — appended SD wave entry.
- **IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md** — added NEW/RENEWED badge row to Batch 1b list table; added 4 pending (⏳ S1+) rows to Batch 3 profile table for renew mutation, markIdReleased mutation, renewal timeline panel, and right-side activity timeline.
- **docs/PRODUCT.md** — NOT touched (`git diff` confirms zero changes; Rule 1 preserved).

### Completed this session (S1 — tRPC backend wave)

- **Shared Zod schemas** — `fisherfolkRenewSchema`, `fisherfolkMarkReleasedSchema`, `fisherfolkActivityQuerySchema` added to `@frms/shared`.
- **`fisherfolk.renew`** (encoderProcedure) — active-violation PRECONDITION_FAILED guard; duplicate-year CONFLICT guard (inside `$transaction`); creates `RegistrationRenewal` + flips `status→RENEWED` + `auditLog(RENEW)` all atomic in one transaction.
- **`fisherfolk.markIdReleased`** (encoderProcedure) — idempotent (early-return if already set); `$transaction` wraps `fisherfolk.update` + `auditLog(UPDATE)`.
- **`fisherfolk.getActivity`** (protectedProcedure) — tenant+entity scoped; sanitized output `{id, action, actorName, createdAt}` — no before/after diffs.
- **`list` select** extended: `+idReleasedAt`, `+_count.renewals` for badge derivation.
- **`getById` include** extended: `+renewals` (take:20, desc) with `renewedBy{name,email}`.
- **Tests** — 5 DB-integration tests in `src/server/trpc/routers/__tests__/fisherfolk.test.ts` (skip in CI; run locally with DATABASE_URL).
- Commit `a9f48c5` on `swarm/registration-status-timeline`.

### Open / pending (not in S1 scope)

- S2+: UI — profile renewal timeline panel + "Mark as Released" action button
- S2+: UI — right-side activity timeline (sanitized AuditLog feed: action/actor/timestamp)
- S2+: UI — NEW/RENEWED badge on fisherfolk list columns (derived from `_count.renewals`)
- Performance indexes (deferred from S0 code review): `@@index([tenantId, renewalYear])` on RegistrationRenewal; index on `fisherfolk(id_released_by_id)`
- TOCTOU on violation check in `renew` (violation.count is pre-transaction; low-probability race) — architectural fix deferred
- `_count.renewals` on `list` runs a COUNT subquery on all list callers including autocomplete dropdowns — consider splitting to a lean `listSummary` for dropdowns (deferred, needs API split)

### Main branch state

`main` is clean at `08f9054` (back-port candidates A–I). All prior PRs (#1–#9) merged.

### Deployment gate

HARD HOLD — no staging/production deploy until owner explicitly authorizes.
